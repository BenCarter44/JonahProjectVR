## About

This project consists of a VR simulation of Jonah and the Whale from the Bible. The user goes back in time to a stormy sea and is swallowed by a whale. After that, instead of the user going to Nineveh, the user finds himself in a college dorm. The user is faced with a question: Will he study for his exam, or spend his time goofing off with friends?

The user decides to run away from his much need-to-be-done homework to go be with friends. Along the way, his homework chases him down and swallows him. This sends him back to the dorm. If the user studies for the exam, the user is teleported to his class to discover that he aced the exam!

This project was a project that my team and I created for our CST-320 class. This class is titled "Human-Computer Interaction and Communication Lecture & Lab". This class focuses on modern ways users can interact with a virtual world--namely VR. This class is also a project management class, teaching storyboarding and project development. This repository contains our work for this project. We hope you enjoy it!!

Thank you,
The team.

## Download instructions.
This repository uses Git LFS. The LFS server is [Ben's RPi-based server](https://codingcando.com/) back at his house. 

To download:
- Clone the repository
- When you clone it, it will appear to "hang" when pulling. It will work! When it is "hanging" is really when it is downloading the large assets from the Git LFS. The failure to see feedback is a bug present in Git LFS.
- Build Settings should be up to date. Should be able to simply press build and run. 
- The scenes may not appear immediately on project load, so you may have to go the scene asset of your choosing in the `Assets/Scenes/` folder.
